# Pathfinder Application

This application is a visual representation of pathfinding using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It displays a grid where a character moves from a start position to a goal position, avoiding unwalkable paths (obstacles). The user can set custom start and goal positions to test the algorithm on different grid configurations.

## Features

- Visual grid layout with walkable and unwalkable paths
- Pathfinding using the BFS algorithm
- User input for custom start and goal positions
- Animated pathfinding process
- Restart the animation at any time with the click of a button

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   python pathfinding_app.py
